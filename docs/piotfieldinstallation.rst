PIoT Field Installation
=======================

.. DANGER::
   Sumps contain water. When dealing with power, make sure to keep moisture
   away from the Raspberry Pi and its power adapter; furthermore, position
   the Raspberry Pi so that it will not fall in the water. Only the sensor
   should be placed over the sump. The Raspberry Pi should be positioned so
   that it will not fall in the water.

Use the Velcro purchased as part of the field installation. Place Velcro on
the bottom of the Raspberry Pi and the breadboard containing the distance
sensor. Aim the sensor at the bottom of the sump, and attach the breadboard
to the side of the sump using the Velcro. Apply the Velcro generously to
ensure that the breadboard does not fall into the sump. Secure the Raspberry
Pi outside of the sump using the Velcro, so that it does not fall into the
sump. Make sure there is enough slack in the jumper wires between the
breadboard and the Raspberry Pi. Connect the power to the Raspberry Pi, making
sure that the Raspberry Pi and its power adapter will not make contact with
moisture.

Congratulations! You should now have a working sump pump monitor.
