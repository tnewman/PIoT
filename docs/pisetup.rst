Raspberry Pi Setup
==================

You will need to install `Raspbian Lite`_ Linux distribution
onto your Raspberry Pi using the `official instructions`_.
`Raspbian Lite`_ is recommended because it is lightweight,
and PIoT was designed to work on it. Other distributions
are not tested and are not recommended.
