Bill of Materials
-----------------

.. TIP::
   It is suggested that you comparison shop using Dr. Google to find the best
   price. The author was unable to find every component from the same site at
   a competitive price.

To build the sump pump monitor, you will need to acquire the following parts:

Assembly
--------

.. DANGER::
   Failure to follow the assembly instructions exactly may result in damage
   to your components. Please be careful!

Assemble the electrical components using the wiring diagram below. In 
addition to following the diagram, you will need to connect the Pi 
Cobbler to the Raspberry Pi and install the Raspberry Pi's case 
as shown below.

You will then have a fully-assembled sump pump monitor similar to the one
below and can setup the Raspberry Pi.
